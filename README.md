Treblle is a lightweight SDK that helps Engineering and Product teams build, ship & maintain REST based APIs faster.

## How Treblle Works
Once you’ve integrated a Treblle SDK in your codebase, this SDK will send requests and response data to your Treblle Dashboard.

In your Treblle Dashboard you get to see real-time requests to your API, auto-generated API docs, API analytics like how fast the response was for an endpoint, the load size of the response, etc.

Treblle also uses the requests sent to your Dashboard to calculate your API score which is a quality score that’s calculated based on the performance, quality, and security best practices for your API.

> Visit [https://docs.treblle.com](http://docs.treblle.com) for the complete documentation.

## Security

### Masking fields
Masking fields ensure certain sensitive data are removed before being sent to Treblle.

To make sure masking is done before any data leaves your server [we built it into all our SDKs](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields#fields-masked-by-default).

This means data masking is super fast and happens on a programming level before the API request is sent to Treblle. You can [customize](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields#custom-masked-fields) exactly which fields are masked when you’re integrating the SDK.

> Visit the [Masked fields](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields) section of the [docs](https://docs.sailscasts.com) for the complete documentation.


## Get Started

1. Sign in to [Treblle](https://platform.treblle.com).
2. [Create a Treblle project](https://docs.treblle.com/en/dashboard/projects#creating-a-project).
3. [Setup the SDK](#install-the-SDK) for your platform.

### Install the SDK
You can install Treblle .NET via NuGet Package Manager or by running the following command:

```sh
Install-Package Treblle.Net
```

You will be prompted to enter your Treblle API key and Project ID. Your settings will be saved in `Web.config` and you can always edit them there.
Here is an example:

```xml
<configuration>
	<appSettings>
		<add  key="TreblleApiKey"  value="{Your_API_Key}"  />
		<add  key="TreblleProjectId"  value="{Your_Project_Id}"  />
	</appSettings>
</configuration>
```

Now you can specify which endpoints you want Treblle to track by adding this simple attribute to any API controller or method:

```csharp

[Treblle]

```

Or, if you are using Trebble with you WCF service, you can specify which endpoints you want Treblle to track by adding the following attribute to any Service class or method:

```csharp

[TreblleBehavior]

```

That's it. Your API requests and responses are now being sent to your Treblle project.
